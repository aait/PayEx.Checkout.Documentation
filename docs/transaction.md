# Transaction
The most granular entity in the API, describes a movement of funds.

## Properties of a transaction
 * **uri**
    * the uri to this resource.
 * **type**
       * the [transaction type](#transaction-types).

 * **amount**
    * `decimal`
    * the amount in this `transaction`

##Transaction-types
###Cancel
A cancel transaction, this releases all available [reserved](#authorize) funds.

### Capture
A capture transaction, it captures funds from [reserved](#authorize).

### Credit
A credit transaction, it credits previously  [captured](#capture), paying them back to the consumer.

### Authorize
An authorize transaction, all transactions available in the api for a api-consumer have this transaction. It is not possible to repeat this transaction.
This transaction reserves funds, making them available for [capture](#capture) or [cancel](#cancel)

## Posting new transactions
To perform a capture, credit or cancel on a payment, the implementer must `POST` a transaction resource to the `payments` `transactions` list.
the resource is identical to the `transaction` recieved, but without a `uri` property, as this is generated by the API.

Posted transactions can only be of [Types](#transaction-types)  [Capture](#capture), [Credit](#credit) and [Cancel](#cancel).

Resource:  `/payments/{paymentId}/transactions/` Where `paymentId` is the `payment-id` recieved from the paymentsession through checkout.js.
This resource requires authentication, authorizing the owner of the payment. see [Authentication](authentication/#back-end-authentication)
